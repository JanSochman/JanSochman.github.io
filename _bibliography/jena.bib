abstract = "This paper presents a video surveillance framework that robustly and efficiently detects abandoned objects in surveillance scenes. The framework is based on a novel threat assessment algorithm which combines the concept of ownership with automatic understanding of social relations in order to infer abandonment of objects. Implementation is achieved through development of a logic-based inference engine based on Prolog. Threat detection performance is conducted by testing against a range of datasets describing realistic situations and demonstrates a reduction in the number of false alarms generated. The proposed system represents the approach employed in the EU SUBITO project (Surveillance of Unattended Baggage and the Identification and Tracking of the Owner)."

    The methodology is applied to face and interest point detection
    and to the RANSAC robust estimator. Error rates of the face
    detector proposed algorithm are comparable to the state-of-the-art
    methods. In the interest point application, the output of the
    Hessian-Laplace detector [Mikolajczyk-IJCV04] is approximated by a
    sequential WaldBoost classifier which is about five times faster
    than the original with comparable repeatability.  A sequential
    strategy based on Wald's SPRT for evaluation of model quality in
    RANSAC leads to significant speed-up in geometric matching

  rates are given, the optimal strategy in terms of the shortest
  average time to decision (number of measurements used) is the Wald's
  sequential probability ratio test (SPRT).  We built on the optimal
  SPRT test and enlarge its capabilities to problems with dependent
  measurements. We show, how the limitations of SPRT to a priori
  ordered measurements and known joint probability density functions
  can be overcome. We propose an algorithm with near optimal time -
  error rate trade-off, called WaldBoost, which integrates the
  AdaBoost algorithm for measurement selection and ordering and the
  joint probability density estimation with the optimal SPRT decision
  strategy.  The WaldBoost algorithm is tested on the face detection
  problem. The results are superior to the state-of-the-art methods in
  average evaluation time and comparable in detection rates.  },

    samples. Each decision in the sequence is made by a separately
    trained classifier, a stage classifier. In proposed modification
    the features from one stage of training are propagated to the next
    stage classifier.  The proposed intra-stage feature propagation is

    complexity of the stage classifier and leads to shorter stage

  abstract = {On-line boosting allows to adapt a trained classifier
to changing environmental conditions or to use sequentially
available training data. Yet, two important problems
in the on-line boosting training remain unsolved:
(i) classifier evaluation speed optimization and, (ii) automatic
classifier complexity estimation. In this paper
we show how the on-line boosting can be combined with
Wald's sequential decision theory to solve both of the
problems.

The properties of the proposed on-line WaldBoost algorithm
are demonstrated on a visual tracking problem.
The complexity of the classifier is changing dynamically
depending on the difficulty of the problem. On average,
a speedup of a factor of 5-10 is achieved compared to
the non-sequential on-line boosting.}
